# Algorithms

I want to use this repository to practise some fundamental computer science concepts.

### Fibonacci

- Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
- Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.
- Test both versions of your functions by passing in various lengths as arguments.

### Merge Sort

- I found the concept of this easyy to understand, but found it very difficult to work out how to implement a solution.
- I ended up finding a little guidance online and reading some possible solutions, and then trying to recreate it myself, once I understood the method.
